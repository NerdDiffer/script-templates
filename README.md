# Scripts

Store & work out any useful scripts or templates here. I can never remember the
damn commands for these kinds of things, so I `ack` the comments in the script
files and go from there.

#### Permissions

As a precaution, I'm *trying to* keep their permissions non-executable while
I'm not using them.

`chmod -x /path/to/script-file.sh`

Just flip the executable permissions when you're using them...

`chmod +x /path/to/script-file.sh`
